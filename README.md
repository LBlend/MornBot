# MornBot

Norwegian multi-purpose Discord bot written for personal use.

This project is no longer being actively maintained. This means that it contains a lot of poorly written code. It is not recommended that you run this bot yourself, however if you want to for some god awful reason, you can. Though, I'm not going to show you how.

It also has a lot of poorly written issues and weird commit messages but I can't be bothered to clean up the mess I've made. The only reason why this repo is still public is for transparency reasons.
