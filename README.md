# MornBot

Norwegian Discord bot written for personal use. **It is not recommended that you use this code. Use at own risk**

## Contributing

If you for some reason want to clean up my shitty code/contribute then these are the requirements:

* Code should meet the PEP8 standard, max 120 char length
* Use single (`'`) quotes unless it's necessary to use double quotation marks (`"`)
* Multi-line comments should use double quotation marks
* Var names should be in snake_case

It is preferred that you also consider the following, however it is not required:

* Use embeds, default embed color should be set to `ctx.me.color`
* All responses should be in norwegian
